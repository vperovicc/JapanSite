# JapanSite

I developed a webpage tailored for a sushi restaurant, featuring dynamic components. The website utilizes top-notch assets for a visually stunning experience and is easily navigable through the navbar.
The entire project was crafted using React.js and Vite, ensuring a seamless and efficient user interface. It was one of the more chalanging encounter on HTML components and positioning with CSS, but at the end
i learned more about it.
